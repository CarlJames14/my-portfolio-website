# Hello Welcome to my Portfolio :tada: :heart: (under development) ðŸš§

![Portfolio | Carl James Roxas](/assets/portfolio-preview.png)

The collection of my works in the field of web development.

## This portofolio is made with HTML, CSS, Sass and vanilla Javascript and of course made with love :heart: .

Compare to the version 1 here in my github repositories that made with React JS, I decided to build my version 2 in a plain Html, css and Javascript and upon making this I also start to learn the Sass (which is my biggest regret not to learn first HAHA).
